# Python general rules
- DO NOT add inline comments to Python code. Python is self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Comments are almost never necessary.
- Use concise numpy-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods. Single-line for simple cases; include parameters and returns for complex ones.
- EXCEPTION: Only add comments for complex algorithms where the "why" is truly non-obvious from reading the code itself. This should be rare.
